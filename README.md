# MeetApp

This app was designed with the thought of college students who needed an easy way to figure out when everyone is available for a meet up.
Users are to join a group via a group ID and enter the times and days they are available onto a calendar. The app will update in realtime (assuming the user is connected) to show when a good time to meet will be.

The app is fundamentally functional, but could use polishing.

*This app is not currently tailored to be released to the public just yet (still a developmental build).*
