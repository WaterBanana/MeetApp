# MeetApp

This Android app was designed with the thought of college students who needed an easy way to figure out when everyone is available for a meet up.
Users are to join a group via a group ID and enter the times and days they are available onto a calendar. The app will update in realtime (assuming the user is connected) to show when a good time to meet will be.

This app is fully functional, though could use polishing.

### A few notes

Swiping through months in the calendar will cause the app to keep loading and pulling data from the network.
Everything is based off of the online network except for retrieving the self availability ribbons. Thus, the app must be connected online in order to function properly.

The colors of the days on the calendar month view is only based on how many users have availability on that particular day. It does not account for whether they share a common time.

### Known Bugs

Month in calendar sometimes does not show up, need to swipe away and back to it for it to load.
